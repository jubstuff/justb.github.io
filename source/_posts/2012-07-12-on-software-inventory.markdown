Few days ago Joel Spolsky published a post on his blog from the title: <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2012/07/09.html">"Software Inventory"</a>.
In this post, he associates "inventory costs" to software, just like a traditional factory. Spolsky highlights these points where inventory piles up:

 * Feature backlogs
 * Bug backlogs
 * Undeployed features

After reading his analysis, I thought that the very difference between baking bread and developing software is the **absence of phisicity**.
Having thousands of ounces of flour is very different from having a thousands more lines of code in a file.
Even if they could have the same cost of management.

What can be the solution, then? We need to make the invisible, visible, and material what is immaterial.
All the things that slow down the development process **must hurt** and be always visible, just like the flour should be stocked in the factory offices.

So, I like the idea that moves [Trello](https://trello.com/), the project manager developed by [Fog Creek](http://www.fogcreek.com)

<blockquote>
  Trello works great for a reasonable amount of inventory, but it <strong>intentionally</strong>
starts to get klunky if you have too many cards in one list.
</blockquote>

Just like a crowded desk, Trello is difficult to manage if there are too many cards.

In the end, there are advantages in the absence of phisicity, but we must consider the hidden costs that very often are ignored.
